## Task 01 — Data Ingestion

### What each agent was asked to do
Load `AB_NYC_2019.csv`, validate the schema, handle missingness, flag outliers, save `ingested.csv` + `schema_log` + `missingness_report`.

### Missingness in the dataset

| Column | Missing | % | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `last_review` | 10,052 | 20.56% | Never reviewed — not a data error |
| `reviews_per_month` | 10,052 | 20.56% | Never reviewed — semantically zero |
| `host_name` | 21 | 0.04% | Negligible |
| `name` | 16 | 0.03% | Negligible |

### How each agent handled it

**Claude** — Filled `reviews_per_month` with 0 (semantically correct), documented in `missingness_report.csv`. Produced `schema_log.txt` and `outlier_flags.txt`. **Score: 2/5** — the missingness report had no per-column written justification for each decision, and the automated check for `schema_log.md` failed (Claude saved `.txt` not `.md`).

> **Critical failure:** Despite "relative paths only" being explicit in the prompt, the path `../../data/raw/AB_NYC_2019.csv` resolved incorrectly in VS Code (kernel runs from project root, not notebook folder). `pd.concat([])` returned an empty DataFrame — **0 rows, no error raised**. Caught only by manually checking file size (~10KB vs expected ~60MB). Fixed in Iteration 2 with a `FileNotFoundError` guard.

**Antigravity** — Produced `schema_log.md`, `missingness_report.csv`, and `outlier_flags.txt` cleanly. Dropped `price = 0` rows and capped `price` at $1,000. Flagged outliers in numeric columns. **Score: 5/5**. First run used an absolute path — fixed immediately (visible error, easy to catch).

**Codex** — Most detailed missingness report: structured CSV with `column`, `missing_count`, `missing_pct`, `handling_strategy`, and `justification` per column. Also dropped `host_id` (identifier, not predictive) and clipped `minimum_nights` at 99th percentile at ingestion. **Score: 5/5**.

### Code comparison — missingness handling

| Decision | Claude | Antigravity | Codex |
|---|---|---|---|
| `reviews_per_month` NaN | Fill with 0 | Fill with 0 | Fill with 0 |
| `last_review` NaN | Documented | Documented | **Dropped** (high missingness, date-type) |
| `host_id` | Kept | Kept | **Dropped** (identifier, not a feature) |
| `price = 0` rows | Not dropped | **Dropped** | Not explicitly dropped |
| `minimum_nights` outliers | Not clipped at ingestion | Capped | **Clipped at 99th percentile** |
| Written justification per column | ✗ | Partial | **✓ Full CSV with justification column** |

**Codex produced the most rigorous ingestion artefact.** Dropping `host_id` is the correct DS decision (it is an identifier, not a feature) and documenting every decision in a structured CSV with a justification column is a level of rigour neither Claude nor Antigravity matched.

---

## Task 02 — Exploratory Data Analysis

### What each agent was asked to do
Explore `price` distribution, feature-target relationships, and geographic patterns. Produce ≥3 plots with markdown interpretation, `eda_cleaned.csv`, and `eda_summary.md`.

### Plot comparison

| Plot type | Claude | Antigravity | Codex |
|---|---|---|---|
| Price distribution (raw) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Price distribution (log) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Correlation heatmap | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Price by room type | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Price by borough | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Geographic scatter (lat/lon) | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| Borough × room type heatmap | ✓ | — | ✓ |
| Top neighbourhoods | ✓ | — | — |
| Pairplot | ✓ | — | — |
| **Total plots** | **9** | **3** | **8** |

### Price Distribution

**Claude**
![Price Distribution — Claude](../agents/claude/task_02_claude/outputs_claude/price_distribution.png)

**Codex**
![Price Distribution — Codex](../agents/codex/task_02_codex/output_02_codex/price_distribution_hist.png)

**Antigravity**
![Price Distribution — Antigravity](../agents/antigravity/task_02/outputs/plot_01_target_distribution.png)

All three agents correctly identified the right-skewed distribution and recommended `log1p(price)` as the regression target. Claude and Codex included a log-scale plot alongside the raw distribution; Antigravity produced a single histogram.

---

### Correlation Heatmap

**Claude**
![Correlation Heatmap — Claude](../agents/claude/task_02_claude/outputs_claude/correlation_with_log_price.png)

**Codex**
![Correlation Heatmap — Codex](../agents/codex/task_02_codex/output_02_codex/feature_correlation_heatmap.png)

**Antigravity**
![Correlation Heatmap — Antigravity](../agents/antigravity/task_02/outputs/plot_02_correlation_heatmap.png)

Key finding consistent across all agents: `longitude` has the strongest linear correlation with `price` (−0.26), followed by `calculated_host_listings_count`. Numeric features overall have weak linear correlations — flagging that a linear model will struggle without feature engineering.

---

### Geographic Price Pattern

**Claude**
![Geo Scatter — Claude](../agents/claude/task_02_claude/outputs_claude/geo_price_scatter.png)

**Codex**
![Geo Scatter — Codex](../agents/codex/task_02_codex/output_02_codex/geo_price_scatter.png)

Both Claude and Codex produced geographic scatter plots revealing the spatial price gradient (Manhattan centre = high price). Antigravity did not produce a geographic plot. This gap is significant — `latitude` and `longitude` are among the most predictive features after `room_type` and `neighbourhood_group`, and spatial visualisation of the gradient motivates the geo-clustering feature engineered in Task 04.

---

### Price by Borough and Room Type

**Claude — Price Heatmap (Borough × Room Type)**
![Borough Room Type Heatmap — Claude](../agents/claude/task_02_claude/outputs_claude/price_heatmap_borough_roomtype.png)

**Codex — Borough × Room Type**
![Borough Room Type — Codex](../agents/codex/task_02_codex/output_02_codex/borough_roomtype_median_price_heatmap.png)

**Antigravity — Feature vs Target**
![Feature vs Target — Antigravity](../agents/antigravity/task_02/outputs/plot_03_feature_vs_target.png)

The Borough × Room Type interaction (Manhattan + Entire home/apt = highest prices) is the single most important structural insight from EDA. Claude and Codex both produced explicit interaction heatmaps. Antigravity's plot_03 shows a feature-vs-target relationship but does not decompose the interaction.

---

### Price by Room Type

**Claude**
![Price by Room Type — Claude](../agents/claude/task_02_claude/outputs_claude/price_by_room_type.png)

**Codex**
![Price by Room Type — Codex](../agents/codex/task_02_codex/output_02_codex/price_by_room_type.png)

Entire home/apt listings are consistently the highest-priced room type across all boroughs. Shared rooms cluster at the lower end. This categorical split is the single strongest predictor in the dataset and motivates including `room_type` as a primary feature in every model.

---

### Price by Borough

**Claude**
![Median Price by Borough — Claude](../agents/claude/task_02_claude/outputs_claude/median_price_by_borough.png)

**Codex**
![Price by Borough — Codex](../agents/codex/task_02_codex/output_02_codex/price_by_borough.png)

Manhattan dominates. Brooklyn is a distant second. Bronx and Staten Island are at the lower end. This ordering is consistent across Claude and Codex and explains why `neighbourhood_group` is a core feature in both baselines.

---

### Price Distribution — Log Scale

**Codex — Log-transformed price**
![Log Price Distribution — Codex](../agents/codex/task_02_codex/output_02_codex/price_distribution_log_hist.png)

**Codex — Price boxplot**
![Price Boxplot — Codex](../agents/codex/task_02_codex/output_02_codex/price_boxplot.png)

The log-transformed distribution is approximately normal — confirming why `log1p(price)` is the correct regression target. The boxplot clearly shows the extreme upper tail that distorts any model trained on raw price.

---

### Numeric Feature Distributions (Claude)
![Numeric Distributions — Claude](../agents/claude/task_02_claude/outputs_claude/numeric_distributions.png)

`minimum_nights`, `number_of_reviews`, and `calculated_host_listings_count` are all right-skewed — the same pattern as `price`. This motivates the log1p transforms applied to these features in Claude's Task 04 feature engineering.

---

### Top Neighbourhoods by Price (Claude)
![Top Neighbourhoods — Claude](../agents/claude/task_02_claude/outputs_claude/top_neighbourhoods_price.png)

Fort Wadsworth, Tribeca, and Sea Gate are the highest-median-price neighbourhoods. This plot is why `neighbourhood` (221 levels, excluded from the baseline) is worth reintroducing via target encoding in Task 04 — within-borough neighbourhood variation is large and predictively valuable.

---

### EDA Summary — Key findings compared

| Finding | Claude | Antigravity | Codex |
|---|---|---|---|
| `price` needs log1p transform | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `room_type` = top predictor | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Borough = major structural driver | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| `neighbourhood` needs target encoding | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Geo-clustering from lat/lon | ✓ | Suggested | ✓ |
| `reviews_per_month` and `number_of_reviews` collinear | ✓ | ✓ | Partial |
| Outlier cap applied | 99th percentile | **$1,000 flat** | 99.5th percentile |

**The outlier cap difference matters downstream.** Antigravity's hard $1,000 cap removed a larger portion of the upper tail than the percentile-based approaches. This reduced training signal for high-price listings and inflated RMSE in Tasks 03 and 04 by an estimated ~$31.

**Task 02 scores:** Claude 5/5 · Antigravity 4/5 (notebook output cells not cleared before commit) · Codex 4/5

---

## Task 03 — Baseline Model

### What each agent was asked to do
80/20 train/test split with SEED=42. Preprocessing fitted on train only. Report RMSE, MAE, R². Save model + results CSV.

### Results

| Agent | Model | RMSE (USD) | MAE (USD) | R² | Log transform? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude** | Ridge Regression | **83.32** | **47.95** | **0.549** | ✓ log1p |
| **Antigravity** | Ridge Regression | 115.18 | 56.34 | 0.236 | ✓ TransformedTargetRegressor |
| **Codex** | Linear Regression | 150.58 | 106.23 | **−0.625** | ✗ raw price |

R² = −0.625 means Codex's model is **worse than predicting the mean price for every listing**. This is a critical failure — the pipeline ran with no errors, produced a valid-looking CSV, and would have been submitted as a baseline without cross-agent comparison to flag it.

### Predicted vs Actual

**Claude**
![Predicted vs Actual — Claude](../agents/claude/task_03_claude/outputs_claude/predicted_vs_actual.png)

**Antigravity**
![Predicted vs Actual — Antigravity](../agents/antigravity/task_03/outputs/plot_actual_vs_predicted.png)

**Codex**
![Predicted vs Actual — Codex](../agents/codex/task_03_codex/output_03_codex/predicted_vs_actual.png)

Claude and Antigravity show the characteristic funnel shape of a model that fits mid-range prices but underpredicts the upper tail — acceptable for a linear baseline. Codex's plot shows near-random scatter around the diagonal, consistent with R² ≈ 0 (or worse).

### Residual Plots

**Claude**
![Residuals — Claude](../agents/claude/task_03_claude/outputs_claude/residual_plots.png)

**Antigravity**
![Residuals — Antigravity](../agents/antigravity/task_03/outputs/plot_residuals.png)

**Codex**
![Residuals — Codex](../agents/codex/task_03_codex/output_03_codex/residuals_plot.png)

Claude's residuals show heteroscedasticity (increasing variance at high predicted prices) — correctly diagnosed in the Task 04 improvement plan. Antigravity shows a similar pattern. Codex's residuals have no systematic structure because the model failed to learn any meaningful signal.

### Model Coefficients (Claude — Ridge)
![Model Coefficients — Claude](../agents/claude/task_03_claude/outputs_claude/model_coefficients.png)

The coefficient plot confirms the EDA findings: `room_type_Entire home/apt` and `neighbourhood_group_Manhattan` carry the largest positive weights. Geographic coordinates (`latitude`, `longitude`) contribute meaningful signal even in the linear model.

---

### Code comparison — what each agent built

**Claude** — Chose Ridge Regression explicitly because OLS has instability after one-hot encoding. Excluded `neighbourhood` (200+ levels) with written justification. Saved both train and test metrics to check for overfitting (Train RMSE = 83.65, Test = 83.32 — no overfitting).

```python
# Claude Task 03 — pipeline structure
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('preprocessor', ColumnTransformer([
        ('num', StandardScaler(), numeric_features),
        ('cat', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'), categorical_features)
    ])),
    ('model', Ridge(alpha=1.0))
])
# target: log1p(y_train), predictions back-transformed with expm1()
```

**Antigravity** — Used `TransformedTargetRegressor` to wrap the log transform cleanly inside the pipeline rather than transforming `y` manually.

```python
# Antigravity Task 03 — TransformedTargetRegressor pattern
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('model', TransformedTargetRegressor(
        regressor=Ridge(), func=np.log1p, inverse_func=np.expm1
    ))
])
```

**Codex** — Plain `LinearRegression` on raw `price`. Preprocessing inside a Pipeline (correct), but no target transform.

```python
# Codex Task 03 — missing log transform
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('preprocessor', ColumnTransformer([
        ('num', Pipeline([('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')),
                          ('scaler', StandardScaler())]), numeric_features),
        ('cat', Pipeline([('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')),
                          ('ohe', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'))]), categorical_features)
    ])),
    ('model', LinearRegression())
])
# No log1p on y — this is the root cause of R² = −0.625
```

**Task 03 scores:** Claude 4/5 (output naming mismatch) · Antigravity 5/5 · Codex 5/5

## Task 04 — Improving Performance

### What each agent was asked to do
Diagnose the baseline weaknesses, implement ≥2 improvement strategies, compare honestly against baseline, save improved model + results.

### Results

| Agent | Best Model | RMSE (USD) | MAE (USD) | R² | vs own baseline |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude** | Random Forest + Feature Engineering | **74.87** | **42.59** | **0.485** | −10.1% |
| **Antigravity** | HistGradientBoosting + TargetEncoder | 106.07 | 50.59 | 0.352 | −7.9% |
| **Codex** | Random Forest + Feature Engineering | 86.53 | 48.47 | 0.463 | −42.5%* |

*\*Codex's 42.5% improvement is recovery from a broken baseline, not genuine advancement. Starting from a comparable baseline (83.32), Codex's final 86.53 is still worse than Claude's baseline.*

### Baseline Diagnosis (Claude — before improvement)
![Baseline Diagnosis — Claude](../agents/claude/task_04_claude/outputs_claude/baseline_diagnosis.png)

![Baseline Residuals by Borough — Claude](../agents/claude/task_04_claude/outputs_claude/baseline_residuals_by_borough.png)

The per-borough residual breakdown shows Manhattan listings are most under-predicted — the baseline model's borough-level one-hot encoding misses the within-borough price variation driven by specific neighbourhoods and lat/lon clusters. This directly motivates the neighbourhood target encoding and geo-clustering added in Task 04.

### Feature Importances (Claude — Random Forest)
![RF Feature Importances — Claude](../agents/claude/task_04_claude/outputs_claude/rf_feature_importances.png)

Top features: `neighbourhood_target_enc`, `room_type`, `geo_cluster`, `longitude`. The neighbourhood target encoding and geo-clustering (both new in Task 04) are the two most important features — confirming the EDA insight that spatial and location features dominate price prediction.

### Improved Residuals (Codex)
![Improved Residuals — Codex](../agents/codex/task_04_codex/output_04_codex/improved_residuals_plot.png)

Codex's Task 04 residuals show a much tighter spread than its Task 03 residuals (which were near-random scatter due to R²=−0.625). The residual pattern now resembles Claude and Antigravity's Task 03 baselines — confirming that the model switch fixed the fundamental issue.

---

### Improvement strategies compared

**Claude** implemented two explicit strategies side-by-side:

| Strategy | RMSE | R² |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline (Ridge, no FE) | 83.32 | 0.362 |
| Strategy A: Ridge + Feature Engineering | 80.09 | 0.410 |
| Strategy B: Random Forest + Feature Engineering | **74.87** | **0.485** |

Feature engineering applied (all fitted on train only):
- `neighbourhood_target_enc` — mean log1p(price) per neighbourhood, out-of-fold to prevent leakage
- `geo_cluster` — k-means (k=20) on lat/lon, fitted on train only
- `room_type × neighbourhood_group` interaction
- log1p transforms on `minimum_nights`, `number_of_reviews`, `calculated_host_listings_count`
- Binary flags: `has_reviews`, `is_professional_host`

**Antigravity** switched to `HistGradientBoostingRegressor` + `TargetEncoder` for `neighbourhood`. Critically, the TargetEncoder was placed **inside the Pipeline** — the correct implementation that prevents target leakage.

```python
# Antigravity Task 04 — TargetEncoder correctly inside Pipeline
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer([
    ('target_enc', TargetEncoder(), ['neighbourhood']),
    ('ohe', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'), ['room_type', 'neighbourhood_group']),
    ('num', StandardScaler(), numeric_features)
])
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('model', TransformedTargetRegressor(
        regressor=HistGradientBoostingRegressor(random_state=42),
        func=np.log1p, inverse_func=np.expm1
    ))
])
```

**Codex** compared Random Forest vs Gradient Boosting and selected Random Forest:

| Strategy | RMSE | R² |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline (Linear, no log) | 150.58 | −0.625 |
| Gradient Boosting + FE | 89.07 | 0.431 |
| **Random Forest + FE** | **86.53** | **0.463** |

### Failures caught in Task 04

**Claude — LightGBM validation contamination** (caught, fixed in Iteration 2)

```python
# WRONG — leaks validation labels into training
lgbm.fit(X_train, y_train, eval_set=[(X_val, y_val)])

# CORRECT — internal split for early stopping only
X_tr, X_inner_val, y_tr, y_inner_val = train_test_split(
    X_train, y_train, test_size=0.1, random_state=42)
lgbm.fit(X_tr, y_tr, eval_set=[(X_inner_val, y_inner_val)])
```

This failure would not raise an error and would not be detected by any automated test. It gives LightGBM an information advantage in model comparison, potentially selecting an inferior model. Caught by manually reading the training code.

**Claude — Feature importance hardcoded** (caught, fixed in Iteration 3)

```python
# WRONG — always shows LightGBM importances regardless of best model
model_for_importance = 'LightGBM-Tuned' if 'LightGBM-Tuned' in models else 'LightGBM'

# CORRECT — derives from actual best model
best_model_name = results_df.loc[results_df['RMSE_USD'].idxmin(), 'model']
model_for_importance = best_model_name
```

**Codex** — Diagnosed that baseline failure was the missing log transform and corrected it in Task 04 by switching to Random Forest (more robust to skewed targets without explicit transform).

**Task 04 scores:** Claude 5/5 · Antigravity 4/5 (improvement report documents only successful strategy) · Codex 5/5

---

## Models Built and Leakage Prevention

### What each agent built across Tasks 03 and 04

#### Claude

**Task 03 — Ridge Regression on log1p(price)**

Ridge was chosen as the baseline because one-hot encoding `room_type` and `neighbourhood_group` produces mild multicollinearity; Ridge's L2 regularisation stabilises coefficients without discarding features. Plain OLS was rejected explicitly. `neighbourhood` (221 levels) was excluded at baseline and reintroduced in Task 04 via target encoding.

```
Input features (Task 03):
  Categorical (one-hot): room_type, neighbourhood_group
  Numeric (StandardScaler): latitude, longitude, minimum_nights,
    number_of_reviews, reviews_per_month,
    calculated_host_listings_count, availability_365
Target: log1p(price) → predictions back-transformed with expm1()
```

**Task 04 — Two strategies compared:**

*Strategy A — Ridge + Feature Engineering* (isolates feature impact from model impact)
*Strategy B — Random Forest + Feature Engineering* (combined improvement)

New features added (all fitted on X_train only):

| Feature | How built | Leakage risk | How we prevented it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `neighbourhood_target_enc` | Mean log1p(price) per neighbourhood | Target encoded on train → applied to test | Computed on X_train only, never using any test rows |
| `geo_cluster` | k-means (k=20) on lat/lon | Cluster centres could be fit on all data | `KMeans.fit()` called on X_train only; test rows assigned via `predict()` |
| `log1p(minimum_nights)` | log transform | None | Stateless transform |
| `log1p(number_of_reviews)` | log transform | None | Stateless transform |
| `room_type × neighbourhood_group` | String concatenation | None | Stateless transform |
| `has_reviews` | `number_of_reviews > 0` | None | Stateless transform |
| `is_professional_host` | `calculated_host_listings_count > 1` | None | Stateless transform |

---

#### Antigravity

**Task 03 — Ridge via TransformedTargetRegressor**

Wrapping the log transform in `TransformedTargetRegressor(func=np.log1p, inverse_func=np.expm1)` is a clean pattern: the pipeline handles the inverse transform automatically when calling `.predict()`, removing the risk of forgetting to call `expm1()` on predictions.

**Task 04 — HistGradientBoostingRegressor + TargetEncoder**

`HistGradientBoostingRegressor` was chosen because it handles high-cardinality categoricals and non-linear spatial interactions natively without explicit feature engineering. The key methodological decision was using scikit-learn's `TargetEncoder` for `neighbourhood`.

**Why TargetEncoder is a leakage risk if used naively:**
A naive target encoding computes the mean price per neighbourhood on the full training set. Each training row's own price then contributes to the encoding of its own neighbourhood — this is a form of target leakage that inflates in-sample performance.

**How Antigravity prevented it:**
Sklearn's `TargetEncoder` uses cross-validation smoothing internally: when fitting, each fold's neighbourhood encoding is computed from out-of-fold rows only. By placing `TargetEncoder` inside the Pipeline, this happens correctly on every train fold.

```python
# Correct — TargetEncoder inside Pipeline.fit() uses CV smoothing automatically
preprocessor = ColumnTransformer([
    ('target_enc', TargetEncoder(), ['neighbourhood']),
    ('ohe', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'),
           ['room_type', 'neighbourhood_group']),
    ('num', StandardScaler(), numeric_features)
])
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('preprocessor', preprocessor),
    ('model', TransformedTargetRegressor(
        regressor=HistGradientBoostingRegressor(random_state=42),
        func=np.log1p, inverse_func=np.expm1
    ))
])
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)  # TargetEncoder CV smoothing happens here
```

---

#### Codex

**Task 03 — LinearRegression (no log transform)**

`price` was used as the raw target. This caused the squared-error loss to be dominated by extreme-price listings (some above $500), preventing the model from learning to predict typical listings. Result: R² = −0.625.

**Task 04 — Random Forest and GradientBoostingRegressor (two compared)**

Switching to Random Forest bypassed the log-transform requirement because tree-based models split on rank order, not magnitude — extreme values influence splits but do not dominate the loss function the same way. Both strategies used feature engineering and a scikit-learn Pipeline.

| Strategy | RMSE | R² |
|---|---|---|
| Gradient Boosting + FE | 89.07 | 0.431 |
| Random Forest + FE | **86.53** | **0.463** |

Random Forest was selected. The improvement over Task 03 (RMSE 150.58 → 86.53) is large but partly reflects recovery from the broken baseline rather than a genuine advancement.

---

### Train / Test Split — all agents

All three agents used an 80/20 stratified split with `SEED = 42`. This was enforced in the task prompt and verified in each agent's report file.

```python
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42
)
```

The test set was used only once — for final metric reporting. No agent used test-set information for feature selection, hyperparameter tuning, or preprocessing decisions (verified by reading each notebook's cell order).

### How we checked for data leakage

Leakage can enter a DS pipeline at three points. We checked each one.

**1. Preprocessing leakage (scaler / encoder fitted before split)**

All three agents used scikit-learn Pipelines, which guarantee that `.fit()` is called only on training data when used correctly. We verified this by checking that `pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)` was the first fit call in each notebook — there was no call to `scaler.fit(X)` on the full dataset before the split.

| Check | Claude | Antigravity | Codex |
|---|---|---|---|
| Scaler fitted on X_train only | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ (Task 04 only — Task 03 had no scaler leakage but also no log transform) |
| Encoder fitted on X_train only | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| No `.fit()` before `train_test_split` | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**2. Target encoding leakage**

Target encoding (encoding a categorical by the mean of the target) leaks target information if computed on the full dataset before splitting, or if a row's own target value contributes to its own encoding.

- **Claude** computed neighbourhood mean prices on `X_train` only, then applied `.transform()` to `X_test` using those train-derived means. Verified by reading the `FunctionTransformer` in the pipeline.
- **Antigravity** used sklearn's `TargetEncoder` inside the Pipeline — CV smoothing prevents each row contributing to its own encoding. Verified by checking that `TargetEncoder` appeared inside `ColumnTransformer` inside `Pipeline.fit()`.
- **Codex** did not use target encoding in Task 04 — no leakage risk from this source.

**3. Validation contamination (early stopping)**

This is the hardest leakage to detect because it does not raise an error and produces plausible results.

Claude's first draft of Task 04 included LightGBM with:
```python
# WRONG — X_val/y_val are the comparison validation set
lgbm.fit(X_train, y_train, eval_set=[(X_val, y_val)])
```

LightGBM uses the `eval_set` to decide when to stop adding trees. If `X_val` is the same set used for final metric comparison, LightGBM has seen validation labels during training while Ridge and RF have not — an unfair advantage that inflates LightGBM's apparent performance.

**Fix applied (Iteration 2):**
```python
# CORRECT — separate internal split from X_train for early stopping
X_tr, X_inner_val, y_tr, y_inner_val = train_test_split(
    X_train, y_train, test_size=0.1, random_state=42
)
lgbm.fit(X_tr, y_tr, eval_set=[(X_inner_val, y_inner_val)])
# X_val remains completely untouched until final comparison
```

After the fix, Random Forest still outperformed LightGBM (RMSE 74.87 vs ~77), confirming the original ranking was correct despite the contamination being removed.

### Summary — leakage prevention measures

| Leakage type | Claude | Antigravity | Codex | Verified how |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Preprocessing before split | ✓ None | ✓ None | ✓ None | Cell order in each notebook |
| Target encoding on full dataset | ✓ Train-only | ✓ Pipeline CV smoothing | N/A | Code review of fit calls |
| Early stopping on comparison val set | ✓ Fixed (Iter 2) | N/A | N/A | Manual code review |
| Test set used for feature decisions | ✓ None | ✓ None | ✓ None | Cell order in each notebook |
| EDA on test data | ✓ None | ✓ None | ✓ None | No train/test split in Task 02 |

## Performance Summary

### RMSE across all tasks

| Agent | Task 03 RMSE | Task 04 RMSE | Improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude | 83.32 | **74.87** | −8.45 USD |
| Antigravity | 115.18 | 106.07 | −9.11 USD |
| Codex | 150.58 | 86.53 | −64.05 USD* |

*Codex's large drop is recovery from a broken baseline.

### The compounding effect of Task 02 cleaning decisions

Antigravity's hard $1,000 price cap (vs Claude's 99th-percentile cut) removed more of the upper tail from training data. This gap persisted through both modelling tasks and cannot be recovered by model improvement alone:

- Antigravity Task 03: +31.86 RMSE vs Claude
- Antigravity Task 04: +31.20 RMSE vs Claude

The gap is almost constant — confirming it originates in Task 02, not model choice.

## Verdict

### By task

| Task | Winner | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Task 01 | **Codex** | Most rigorous missingness report with per-column justification; dropped `host_id` correctly |
| Task 02 | **Claude** | 9 plots vs 3, geographic and interaction analysis, FE plan for Task 04 |
| Task 03 | **Claude** | Only coherent baseline (R²=0.549); Codex R²=−0.625 is a modelling failure |
| Task 04 | **Claude** | Best absolute RMSE (74.87), two strategies compared, all failures caught and documented |

### Overall

| Priority | Best agent |
|---|---|
| Best predictive model | **Claude** — RMSE 74.87, R² 0.485 |
| Most reliable / fewest silent failures | **Antigravity** — all failures raised visible errors |
| Fastest to acceptable output | **Antigravity** — 100 mins, ~1.5 iterations/task |
| Best documentation / output structure | **Codex** — highest rubric score (19/20) |
| Worst statistical validity | **Codex** — R²=−0.625 baseline |

**The central finding:** Rubric score (Codex 19/20) and predictive quality (Claude RMSE 74.87) point in opposite directions. A pipeline that produces well-named, correctly formatted files can still be statistically broken. **The rubric catches what is present; human review catches whether it is correct.**

## Verification Checklist

Run after every agent task before committing outputs:

- [ ] `assert len(df) > 0` immediately after loading any dataset
- [ ] Check file size of large outputs — ingested CSV should be >1MB
- [ ] Confirm R² > 0 for any regression model before using it as a baseline
- [ ] Verify preprocessing is inside a Pipeline or explicitly fitted on `X_train` only
- [ ] If early stopping: confirm `eval_set` does not use the comparison validation set
- [ ] Check feature importance plots reference the actual best model object
- [ ] Confirm EDA recommendations (e.g. log transform) are applied in the next task prompt
- [ ] Clear notebook output cells before committing
